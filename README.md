# TitaniumPhoenix
A stylish proxy site with many features. Easy to modify and flows well.

#### Basic info

I'm going to be updating this *hopefully* frequently and with new servers and some features. I know this isn't a super advanced thing but it's one of my first projects so yeah.

For the YouTube proxy, you **need** an api key from Google with the *Youtube Data API v3* enabled. This needs to be placed in the `apikey` environment variable. This can be obtained at https://console.developers.google.com/.

Initial Release Date: July 13, 2018.
# Features

#### Locally Stored and Hosted Proxy Server

This allows your PhoenixHub site to have a proxy already equipped when you deploy it so you can quickly get to circumventing censorship!

#### Locally Stored YouTube Proxy

Since YouTube does not work on the Local Proxy, we came up with this as a solution: The YouTube Proxy!

The YouTube Proxy allows streaming of resolutions and framerates of 4K and 60 FPS, and will allow playback of any video and it uses YouTube's URL patterns for easy of use.

#### Games

This site has links to many games on a JSCDN for quick and efficient access.

#### Chatboxes

Chatboxes for TitaniumNetwork's Services. Replace if needed.
